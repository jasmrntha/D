        <h2>CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.</h2>
        <h3>CSS defines three types of gradients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)</li>
            <li>Radial Gradients (defined by their center)</li>
            <li>Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="kotak">
        <h3>CSS Linear Gradients</h3>
        <p>
            To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
